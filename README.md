This repository contains the code associated with the research paper titled "Local Contractive Registration with Biomechanical Model: Assessing Microwave Ablation after Compensation for Tissue Shrinkage". 



Currently, only the binary version of the code is available as the paper is still under review. Once the paper gets accepted, the source code will be updated accordingly.



Note that there is still ample room for optimization in the code, and I will come back to provide updates once I am done with my academic commitments 🐱‍🏍.





Environment Dependencies:
